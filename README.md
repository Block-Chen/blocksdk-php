## Getting Started
**Install the SDK** â€“ Using [Composer] is the recommended way to install the
   BlockSDK for PHP. The SDK is available via [Packagist] under the
   [`block-chen/blocksdk-php`][install-packagist] package. If Composer is installed globally on your system, you can run the following in the base directory of your project to add the SDK as a dependency:
   ```
   composer require block-chen/blocksdk-php
   ```
